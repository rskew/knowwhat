## Quick start

You will either need [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed.

npm run dev     # run development server
npm run build   # build production assets
```

## Development

We use [spago](https://github.com/spacchetti/spago) to manage our Purescript dependencies.
While this is installed as a `dev-dependency` in `package.json` you may want to install it directly to make it easier to manage these dependencies directly.
