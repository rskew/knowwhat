Prototype task tracking application. Record subtasks and collapse/expand groups, never losing track of the goals your tasks are heading towards.

To try it, run `pulp build` in the `purescript` directory to compile the purescript sources to javascript, then run `parcel ./index.html` in the top level directory to run the hotloading server at `localhost:1234` (hotloading needs work :/)
